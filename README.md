# üîê Encryption and Decryption in Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **message encryption and decryption** using Python. The main goal is to encode a message so that it becomes unreadable without the proper key, and then decode it back to its original form.

Whether you're exploring the basics of cryptography or looking to integrate secure communication in your applications, this project serves as a foundational starting point.

## Features

- üîí Encrypt plain text messages  
- üîì Decrypt encoded messages  
- üß† Simple, beginner-friendly code  
- üìÑ Easy to modify and extend  

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Custom encryption logic (can be replaced with libraries like `cryptography` or `Fernet`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-decryption-python.git
   cd encryption-decryption-python
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python encrypt_decrypt.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a message and view its encrypted and decrypted forms.

## Example

```plaintext
Original Message: Hello, World!
Encrypted Message: Khoor/#Zruog$
Decrypted Message: Hello, World!
```

## Future Improvements

- Add GUI with Tkinter or PyQt
- Support for file encryption
- Integration with more secure encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA)
